This result is generated under the condition there is no block from testbench side.
So in real working environment, the suggested depth may need some margin.

After FIFO sizing, module total executing time has no change.(still 134370 cycles)
The detailed FIFO info are listed below.
    FIFO(AESL_inst_spmv_opt3.grp_spmv_kernel_opt3_fu_256.row_fifo_U):
    {
        The user setting depth:       2.
        The smallest suggest depth:       129.
        Involved in deadlock path:        Yes.
        Work mode:
            FIFO never blocks its consumer and producer.
            The possible reason is the FIFO depth is big enough.

        Work mode:
            FIFO always blocks its producer.
            FIFO may sometimes or never blocks its consumer.
            The possible reason is the producer works fast for this channel.
